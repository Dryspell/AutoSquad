# üß© AutoSquad Modular Agent System

## Overview

AutoSquad v0.3 introduces a revolutionary **modular agent system** that allows projects to define custom agent roles and leverage diverse perspectives for enhanced collaboration. This system moves beyond the traditional static roles to enable project-specific expertise and cultural diversity that brings unique insights to every project.

## üéØ Key Innovations

### 1. **Project-Specific Agent Roles**
Instead of being limited to fixed roles (Engineer, Architect, PM, QA), projects can now define custom agents with specialized expertise tailored to their specific domain.

### 2. **Perspective-Based Diversity** ‚≠ê **BREAKTHROUGH FEATURE**
Agents can be configured with diverse cultural, geographic, and professional backgrounds, bringing unique viewpoints and insights that enhance problem-solving and solution quality.

### 3. **Dynamic Agent Creation**
Agents are created dynamically based on project configuration files, allowing unlimited customization and specialization.

### Creative Writing with Role Specialization
**Agents**: Story Architect, Content Creator, Editorial Specialist, Publishing Strategist, Literary Analyst

**Value**: Each agent focuses on specific aspects of the creative process while maintaining overall narrative coherence.

### Legal Services with Cultural Sensitivity
**Agents**: Contract Specialist (US), International Law Expert (EU), Risk Assessor (Asia-Pacific), Compliance Monitor (Multi-jurisdictional)

**Value**: Ensures legal solutions work across different regulatory environments and cultural contexts.

## üöÄ Using the Modular Agent System

### 1. Create Agent Configuration
```bash
# Option 1: Enhanced prompt.txt with embedded YAML
projects/my-project/prompt.txt

# Option 2: Separate YAML configuration
projects/my-project/agents.yaml

# Option 3: Inline configuration in project file
projects/my-project/config.yaml
```

### 2. Run AutoSquad with Dynamic Agents
```bash
# AutoSquad automatically detects and uses custom agent configurations
python -m squad_runner projects/my-project

# Or explicitly specify configuration
python -m squad_runner projects/my-project --config agents.yaml
```

### 3. Agent Creation Process
1. **Parse Configuration**: Project file is parsed for agent definitions
2. **Validate Roles**: Agent configurations are validated for required fields
3. **Create Dynamic Agents**: DynamicAgent instances are created with custom prompts
4. **Initialize Collaboration**: Agents are registered and begin collaboration

## üí° Best Practices

### Role Definition Guidelines
- **Clear Specialization**: Each agent should have distinct expertise areas
- **Complementary Skills**: Agent roles should cover all project needs without overlap
- **Realistic Scope**: Don't give agents too many responsibilities
- **Tools Alignment**: Ensure agents have tools that match their responsibilities

### Perspective Configuration Tips
- **Authentic Backgrounds**: Use realistic cultural and professional contexts
- **Relevant Experience**: Choose perspectives that add value to the project
- **Balanced Diversity**: Include diverse viewpoints without tokenism
- **Specific Insights**: Define concrete unique insights each perspective brings

### Workflow Optimization
- **Perspective Rotation**: Ensure each agent contributes their unique viewpoint
- **Cultural Validation**: Include steps that validate solutions across cultural contexts
- **Expertise Sequencing**: Order collaboration phases to leverage specialized knowledge effectively

## üîÑ Migration from Static Agents

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing projects continue to work with static agents (engineer, architect, pm, qa)
- Static agents can be mixed with dynamic agents in the same project
- Default agent configurations are automatically created for projects without custom agents

### Gradual Adoption
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with role customization before adding perspectives
2. **Test Configurations**: Validate agent configurations with small projects
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Refine agent definitions based on collaboration results
4. **Scale to Complex Projects**: Apply learnings to larger, more complex initiatives
