## 🚀 Ready for Testing

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_install.py
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Create a project
python -m squad_runner.cli create --name my-test

# Run a squad
python -m squad_runner.cli run --project projects/example-cli-tool
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test AutoGen Integration** - Verify all AutoGen imports and basic agent creation
2. **End-to-End Testing** - Run the example project and debug any issues
3. **Agent Tools** - Implement file operations and code execution for agents
4. **Polish & Documentation** - Add setup guides and troubleshooting

## 💎 Key Features Implemented

- **Specialized Agent Roles** - PM, Engineer, Architect, QA with distinct personalities
- **Project Workspace Management** - Isolated workspaces with file operations
- **Squad Profiles** - Predefined team compositions (MVP, Full-Stack, Research)
- **Conversation Logging** - Complete chat history and workspace state tracking
- **Configuration Management** - YAML configs with environment variable support
- **Beautiful CLI** - Rich formatting, progress bars, and helpful error messages

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Layered Design** - AutoSquad orchestration layer on top of AutoGen foundation
- **Project Context Awareness** - Agents understand their workspace and objectives
- **Extensible Agent Framework** - Easy to add new agent types and capabilities
- **Robust Error Handling** - Comprehensive logging and state management
- **Clean Separation of Concerns** - CLI, orchestration, agents, and project management are decoupled

## 📊 Code Quality
