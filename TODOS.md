## üéØ MVP Definition

**Minimum viable AutoSquad should be able to:**

1. ‚úÖ Load a simple text prompt from a project folder
2. ‚úÖ Spin up a 3-agent team (PM, Engineer, Architect)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Have agents collaborate for 3-5 rounds via AutoGen (needs testing)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Generate working code in the project workspace (needs validation)
5. ‚úÖ Save complete conversation logs
6. ‚úÖ Provide basic CLI for running squads

**Current Status: 4/6 complete, 2 need testing**

## üîß Technical Decisions Needed

### AutoGen Specifics

- [ ] Which AutoGen runtime to use (local vs distributed)
- [ ] Code execution environment configuration
- [ ] LLM provider strategy (OpenAI vs Azure vs multiple)
- [ ] Message passing patterns for squad coordination

### Architecture Choices

- [ ] Configuration management approach (YAML vs JSON vs Python)
- [ ] Logging and monitoring strategy
- [ ] Error handling and recovery patterns
- [ ] Testing strategy for multi-agent workflows

### Performance & Scaling

- [ ] Concurrent vs sequential agent execution
- [ ] Memory management for long conversations
- [ ] File system performance for large projects
- [ ] Rate limiting and cost management

## üìù Notes

### AutoGen Learning Resources

- [ ] Study AutoGen documentation and examples
- [ ] Explore AutoGen Studio for UI patterns
- [ ] Research existing AutoGen agent patterns
- [ ] Test AutoGen extensions ecosystem

### Development Workflow

- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create testing strategy for agent behaviors
- [ ] Establish code review process
- [ ] Plan integration testing approach

## üéâ Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Success**: ‚úÖ Can run a basic AutoGen conversation and save results (CODE COMPLETE)
**Phase 2 Success**: ‚úÖ Agents can read/write files and have specialized behaviors (CODE COMPLETE)  
**Phase 3 Success**: ‚úÖ Full squad can collaborate on a simple coding task (CODE COMPLETE)
**MVP Success**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Can generate a working CLI tool from a text prompt (NEEDS TESTING)
**Full Success**: ‚ùå Consistently produces high-quality software projects autonomously (FUTURE)
