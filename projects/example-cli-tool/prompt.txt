Build a CLI tool that helps writers brainstorm character names for their stories. The tool should:

1. Generate random character names based on different genres (fantasy, sci-fi, modern, historical)
2. Allow users to specify gender preferences or generate gender-neutral names
3. Provide brief character background suggestions with each name
4. Save favorite names to a file for later reference
5. Have a simple, intuitive command-line interface

The tool should be easy to install and use, with helpful documentation and error handling.
